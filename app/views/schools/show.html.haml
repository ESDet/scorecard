      %h3 Student Performance Growth
      %p This year, we can only report if students state standards or not. In the future, we how much students progress. Every student should progress one entire grade level each year. But sometimes, students progress a lot and they still are not meeting state standards because they started the year so far behind. We think it is important to show which schools are helping students progress, even if their students are not yet meeting standards.
