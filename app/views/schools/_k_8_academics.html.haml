        //    %b STEP #2:
        //    %p Will is then matched with all other 4th graders across Michigan who also scored roughly 397 on the MEAP reading exam in 2012. We’ll call them Will’s Academic Peers.<br/>
        //    %b STEP #3:
        //    %p One year later, in 2013, Will and his Academic Peers take the 5th grade MEAP reading test. Will scored 522, while his Academic Peers scored 509 on average. Compared to his peers, Will has grown further. This difference in growth is Will’s growth measure, and in Will’s case, its positive.<br/>
        //    %b STEP #4
        //    %p To find the growth of an entire Detroit school, we calculated each individual student’s growth using this method and averaged them altogether.
